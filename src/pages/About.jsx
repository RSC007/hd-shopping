        Product information is any information about a product that helps
        customers make an informed decision before buying it. This includes
        information about the product's price, dimensions, SKU number,
        functions, features and benefits, colors, accessories, and more. Product
        information can be found on product packaging, product inserts, product
        labels, brochures, product information sheets, product catalogs, and
        online product detail pages. Product information management (PIM) is the
        process of managing all the information required to market and sell
        products through distribution channels. PIM systems consolidate all
        product information onto a single platform, helping connect retailing
        and manufacturing channels.

            Electronics is a branch of physics and engineering that studies and
            applies the principles of physics to design, create, and operate
            devices that manipulate electrons and other electrically charged
            particles. It has influenced the development of modern society and
            is used in a whole host of applications such as information
            processing, telecommunication and signal processing. Electronics
            deals with circuits, transistors, microchips, and the behavior and
            movement of electrons. It uses underlying techniques and uses active
            devices to control electron flow by amplification and rectification
            rather than just using passive effects such as resistance,
            capacitance and inductance. The four basic types of electronic
            components include capacitors, resistors, diodes, and transistors.
            Each of these types perform specific function when added into an
            electronic system. Some simple electronic components include{" "}
